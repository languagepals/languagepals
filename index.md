# About LanguagePals
The problem: UH has a second language requirement, but it is often difficult to find people to practice the language with, even though the large number of foreign students means there is a large potential pool of candidates (who might, in turn, want to practice their English).

The solution: LanguagePals will match up students who are fluent in English and need practice in a foreign language with students who are fluent in the foreign language but need practice in English. 

#Goals
Students can create a profile with the language(s) they want to practice and constraints on when they can get together with another person. A profile can be displayed as a card in a list of results of a search. Perhaps a search result for student who match with your search can look similar to bowfolios' directory page:

It can also be possible to meet virtually through Skype or some other communication app. Each user profile could have a calendar with available meeting times over specified mediums that the user maintains. Then another user could ask to set up a meeting with another user by clicking on their calendar. Maybe it could look something like fareharbors system for scheduling:

The system will also provide example “talk story” session outlines to help the meetups be productive.
