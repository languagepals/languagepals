# About LanguagePals
The problem: UH has a second language requirement, but it is often difficult to find people to practice the language with, even though the large number of foreign students means there is a large potential pool of candidates (who might, in turn, want to practice their English).

The solution: LanguagePals will match up students who are fluent in English and need practice in a foreign language with students who are fluent in the foreign language but need practice in English. Students can create a profile with the language(s) they want to practice and constraints on when they can get together with another person. It can also be possible to meet virtually through Skype or some other communication app. The system will also provide example “talk story” session outlines to help the meetups be productive.
